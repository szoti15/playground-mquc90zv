# Operators

>Operators are special symbols that perform specific operations on one, two, or three operands, and then return a result.
The operators in the following table are listed according to precedence order.
When operators of equal precedence appear in the same expression, a rule must govern which is evaluated first. 
All binary operators except for the assignment operators are evaluated from left to right (assignment operators are evaluated right to left)


| Operators             | Precedence
| --------------------- | ---------- 
| postfix	        | expr++, expr-- 
| unary	                | ++expr, --expr, +expr, -expr, ~, ! 
| multiplicative        | *, /, % 
| additive              | +, - 
| shift	                | <<, >>, >>> 
| relational            | <, >, <=, >=, instanceof 
| equality              | ==, != 
| bitwise AND           | & 
| bitwise exclusive OR  | ^ 
| bitwise inclusive OR  | | 
| logical AND           | && 
| logical OR            | || 
| ternary               | ? : 
| assignment            | =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, &=, ^=, |=, <<=, >>=, >>>= 


### Simple assignment Operator
the most common operator
	operand from roght to left
	can also be used to assign object references
